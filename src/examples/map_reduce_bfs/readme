In order to generate input for map_reduce_bfs run:
graph_generator <N> <E> <file> 
where:
    - N - vertex count
    - E - number of edges in connected graph. 
    - file - file with input for program
graph_generator outputs standard sequential solution to the problem, so outputs of both programs can
be compared to check if mpi implementation is correct.
